Next enter a burger! Any burger you would want to devour!
Once the burger has been added to the devour list. Devour it and it will now show up under your devoured list.

### Scalability
Color styling / and a theme for the page is our next goal. This app has the potential to become something similar to a grocery-list because of its functionality. Allowing its user to move an item from one status to another, with a delete button for items.
